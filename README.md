# Repo1
1st Project

The project is related to the conversion of a digit ranging from -999999 to +999999 to its corresponding words value.
Currently it has been restricted to above listed range with the help of a pattern matcher, however, the same can be extended to higher values as well by updating the pattern that checks the input value.

To test the program, you can directly import the project and run it in the eclipse itself and use the eclipse console to provide the input. You will be notified with the output in the console itself.

All the numbers between -999999 to +999999 are treated as valid inputs and are processed further. Anything that differs with the range or pattern are treated as invalid inputs and we get the "Invalid input" message in the console for them.
